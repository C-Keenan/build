                <h3>Game Server Helper</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>'Game Server Helper' is a Debian/Linux command-line script interface designed to run various popular game servers such as "Minecraft", "Veloren", "Satisfactory", and "Factorio" by utilizing the 'Docker Compose' program.</p>
                    <h4>Installation</h4>
                    <p>If you run the install script it will first ask if you would like to install the command-line scripts, which entails adding an alias to the current user's '.bashrc' file directed to the installation directory `/usr/gsh/script-files/gsh`, it will then copy the 'gsh' folder, which includes the default docker-compose.yml files for the various game servers distributed with the script, into the linux 'usr' directory and then pull the necessary linux packages "docker-ce", "docker-ce-cli", "containerd.io", "docker-buildx-plugin", and "docker-compose-plugin". It then asks you if you would like to test the docker installation, which is not usually necessary, and run the `docker run hello-world` command, which is the 'Docker' test image, to make sure that the installation is up and running correctly. The next step is to check whether or not the system has the required 'colrm' utility utilized by the alias command `gsh factorio down` which checks the factorio 'server-settings.json' file for the autosave interval and runs a timer to allow an autosave to happen so the user does not lose any recent game progress which might occur if the container is brought down immediately which can still be done by running the alias command `gsh factorio down --now`. The installation script will then check to see if the environment directory, used by the donation message function of the script, is in existance on the system and copy the necessary environment files into said directory. There are also default environment files for each of the various game servers that are packaged along-side the script which are necessary for the servers to function as expected by the script that are copied into the respective docker container folders at this point in the script. The script will then print a closing message thanking the user for installing the 'Game Server Helper' script and directing them to provide feature requests to the email address specified in the installation script. The installation script can be run as the 'root' user or a general user with 'sudo' privledges, and should be capable of running on debian linux systems that do not contain the 'sudo' package.<br><br>If the user answers "no" to the installation script asking if you would like to install 'Game Server Helper' then the script will first print a message thanking the user for running the script and mentioning that since they answered "no" the script will now exit and reminding them to "Have a great day!"</p>
                    <h4>Main Script Overview</h4>
                    <p>The functions and features of the main script known as 'gsh' are as follows:<br>- Incrementation of the 'donation-ticker' environment variable<br>- Control of the various game servers via the designated command syntax which can be found by running the alias command `gsh --help` or by simply running the alias command `gsh` with no arguments<br><br></p>
                    <h4>Donation Ticker Incrementation</h4>
                    <p>The donation ticker incrementation happens every time you run the 'gsh' script, with exception to the 'tail-logs' function of each game server, and requires the input of the sudo password, ONLY processed by the sudo package NOT stored in the script or as a variable, or for the user to be 'root'. The reason the sudo password is necessary is because it stores the new value of `$dt` into the '/tmp/donation-ticker.env' file and copies that file to the '/usr/gsh/environment/donation-ticker.env' file overwriting the previous file which needs the user to have sudo privledges or be 'root'. The donation ticker function can be entirely turned off by editing the '/usr/gsh/environment/donation-ctrl.env' file and setting 'donationmessage' to '1'. This will cause the script to no longer check the 'donation-ticker.env' file and see if it is equal to a multiple of 30 thus printing the message and incrementing the value 'dt+1'. If the script is allowed to check the value, if the value is equal to one less than a multiple of 30 at the time of execution it will increment the value of 'dt' and exit resulting in the next run of the script printing the donation reminder message.</p>
                    <h4>Game Server Control Implementation</h4>
                    <h4>Factorio</h4>
                    <p>The 'Factorio' game server control implementation is special in that, I am unaware of whether the container saves the game state on exit, so to be safe I made it to where the script checks the 'server-settings.json' file located at '/usr/gsh/docker/factorio/config/server-settings.json' and looks for the entry 'autosave_interval' and, as there are currently two lines that equate to that search query in the file, it prints the second line containing the actual value and removes the unnecessary data utilizing the 'colrm' utility to get just the value and multiplies that value by 60 thus resulting in the amount of seconds to wait before running the `docker compose -f 'factorio docker file' down' command. It does need to lock the terminal at this point but prints a human-readable timer to let you know how long you have to wait for the 'down' command to run after which the terminal will be free to use for other commands. The other game servers all have their own implemetation of the 'save on exit' function so this behaviour is only exhibited by the 'gsh factorio down' alias command. This behaviour can also be skipped by running `gsh factorio down --now` which will skip the timer and immediately bring the container to a halt with the same behaviour as the `docker compose down` command.</p>
                    <h4>Satisfactory, Minecraft, Veloren, and the rest of Factorio</h4>
                    <p>The other game server control implementations are rather simple, in that, they only require the user to type `gsh "game-name" "argument"` to do their jobs. The following are accepted commands and there functions:<br>- To bring a game server up all one needs to type is `gsh "game-name" up`<br>- To bring a game server down `gsh "game-name" down`, with the notable exception being 'Factorio' as explained above<br>- To print the logs and exit `gsh "game-name" logs`<br>- To print and follow the logs `gsh "game-name" tail-logs`<br>- To pull the docker image associated with the respective 'docker-compose.yml' file `gsh "game-name" pull`<br>- To print the help message for the associated game `gsh "game-name" --help` or `gsh "game-name"`</p>
